spatialFDA is a tool to calculate spatial statistics functions on a `SpatialExperiment`
object using the `spatstat` library. It contains functions to plot these spatial statistics functions. In addition, users can compare the statial statistics functions using functional data analysis. Here, we use the `refund` library.
